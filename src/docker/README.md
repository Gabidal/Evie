# Is this related to the commonly used Docker?

### No, by name Docker, it has no connection with the actual product Docker, which is used outside of Evie.


# Why is it then called Docker?

### The name docker derives from the idea of an shipyard where different ships and cargo carriers can Dock into and load/unload their specific needs.


# What does it specifically do then?

### As the name implies, Docker is an bridge system for Evie to be able to use different file types directly at compile time without any header files involved (note: templates are still needed, if the specific prebuilt file utilizes them.).


# What are the file types Evie Docker can handle?

### Docker can handle: `LIB`, `DLL`, `OBJ`, `ASM` and native `E` files.
