# Evie

### This is a rewrite of the this repo: https://github.com/Gabidal/Evie_Old

## Why make an total rewrite?

### While i was working on GGUI for the past six months i have tried to make my resulting code more professional, also on my job i have also learned a lot about how to make production ready code and configuration, and so i wanted to integrate what i had learned into my side hobbies too, including Evie.

## What changed?

### Where this total rewrite will include my new skills and the following code from it, the same base ideology will stay the same. Syntax and features from old Evie will be transferred and worked upon.

## What do i expect?

### Fun, since i love coding and creating stuff, but also better maintainability for the whole code base.
